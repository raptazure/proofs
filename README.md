# Proofs

### @ the Repo

After the third semester in HIT, I made my mind to apply for graduate school to learn more about programming language theory (maybe NJU PL Group is good for me). So I must work harder on school courses now... 

This repository is all about my favourite proof assistants and they are willing to provide the *dream verification service*. It will remind me what I should do to **fill the goal**.
