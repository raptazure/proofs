# Proofs

I want to learn more about:

- Type Theory
- Formal Verification
- Functional PL Design & Implementation

And I must work harder on school courses now...

This repository is all about my favourite proof assistants and they are willing to provide the *dream verification service*. It will remind me what I should do to **fill the goal**.
